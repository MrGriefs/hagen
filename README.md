# Hagen

## Purpose

In as many languages as possible, 'hagen' must be spammed without exiting, followed by a new line and must always be lowercase.

## Contribute

You can add a missing language by [forking](https://github.com/MrGriefs/hagen/fork) and submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/MrGriefs/hagen/pulls) with your change.  
The newly added language filenames must follow the format `hagen.:ext`, where `:ext` is the language file extension.  
If this file already exists and not the same language, you can prefix the extension with some form of specification. i.e. Node.js becomes `hagen.node.js`.
